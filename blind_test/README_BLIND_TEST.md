# Blind Context Test

## Instructions for New LLM Session

1. Open a NEW Claude/LLM session (no context from previous conversation)
2. Ask it to read the `quality_control_chunks.txt` file
3. Ask it to create a comprehensive summary of what the document is about
4. Compare with the original PDF to see if context was preserved

## What to Look For

- Can the LLM understand what each chunk is about?
- Do the contextual headers help?
- Is the document's structure and flow preserved?
- Are key concepts and relationships clear?

## Files

- `quality_control_chunks.txt` - Human-readable chunks
- `quality_control_chunks.json` - JSON format with metadata
