# Search Precision Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

Evaluated the precision of the llmfy knowledge base indexing system by searching for 5 specific technical details. The system showed mixed results, with some exact information indexed but not always retrieved as the top result.

## Test Results

### 1. "67% failure reduction" - Anthropic's context independence statistic
- **Status**: ✅ INDEXED
- **Found in**: `/Users/lech/02_knowledge/llmfy/blind_test/quality_control_chunks.json`
- **Exact text**: "they cut failed retrievals by up to 67% – a massive boost in accuracy"
- **Search performance**: Not retrieved in top results when searching for "67% failure reduction"
- **Issue**: The search query didn't match well enough with the indexed content

### 2. "250 tokens optimal chunk size" - Research recommendation
- **Status**: ✅ INDEXED
- **Found in**: Multiple locations including:
  - `src/core/smart_ingestion.py`: "~250 tokens per chunk"
  - `src/core/text_processor_v2.py`: "Optimal chunk sizing (200-300 tokens)"
  - `RESEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: "Chunk size: 1000 chars → 250 tokens"
- **Search performance**: Retrieved document about "Chunk Size Optimization" but not the specific 250 token recommendation
- **Issue**: The exact phrase wasn't in a single chunk

### 3. "MCP servers shared between Claude Desktop and Claude Code"
- **Status**: ❌ NOT INDEXED
- **Search performance**: Retrieved MCP-related documents but not this specific configuration detail
- **Issue**: This information from CLAUDE.md may not have been ingested into the knowledge base

### 4. "Pinecone serverless"
- **Status**: ❌ NOT INDEXED as "serverless"
- **Search performance**: Found many Pinecone references but not specifically about serverless
- **Issue**: The term "serverless" doesn't appear with Pinecone in the indexed content

### 5. "text-embedding-ada-002" - OpenAI embedding model
- **Status**: ✅ INDEXED
- **Found in**: Multiple code files and documentation
- **Search performance**: ✅ EXCELLENT - Top result was directly about this model
- **Top result**: "OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model creates 1536-dimensio..."

## Analysis

### Precision Metrics
- **Exact matches found**: 3/5 (60%)
- **Retrieved in top results**: 1/5 (20%)
- **Semantic matches**: 5/5 (100%) - all queries returned related content

### Key Findings

1. **Exact phrase matching is weak**: The system struggles when the search query doesn't closely match the indexed text structure

2. **Context fragmentation**: Important information like "67% failure reduction" is embedded in larger chunks, making it harder to retrieve with specific queries

3. **Missing content**: Some expected content (MCP configuration details) appears to not be in the knowledge base

4. **Strong semantic understanding**: Even when exact matches fail, the system returns semantically related content

### Similarity Score Analysis
- Highest scores: ~0.8-0.9 for direct matches
- Average scores: ~0.6-0.7 for semantic matches
- The system uses both local (384-dim) and OpenAI (1536-dim) embeddings

## Recommendations

1. **Improve chunk extraction**: Create more focused chunks around key statistics and facts
2. **Add keyword extraction**: Index important numbers and technical terms separately
3. **Verify content coverage**: Ensure all project documentation is ingested
4. **Consider hybrid search**: Combine semantic search with keyword matching for better precision
5. **Chunk overlap**: Add overlapping chunks to capture context boundaries better

## Technical Details

- **Total chunks indexed**: 1,016
- **Collections**: 
  - main: 247 chunks (384-dim local embeddings)
  - hybrid: 769 chunks (1536-dim OpenAI embeddings)
- **Search implementation**: Uses ChromaDB with unified search across collections
