# Codex Report

## Changes Made
- Removed stray shell prompt text from multiple scripts and markdown files.
- Ensured all files end with a trailing newline.
- Fixed truncated lines in `README.md` and added an AI generated content disclaimer.
- Cleaned `requirements.txt` and restored final dependency line.
- Updated `KnowledgeQualityAnalyzer` to use a portable default data path.
- Replaced several lingering `Nexus` references with `llmfy`.
- Installed optional dependency `chromadb` so tests collect properly.

## Testing
- `python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')` executed without errors.
- `pytest -q` runs and reports no tests.
