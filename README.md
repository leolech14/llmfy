llmfy is a sophisticated document processing pipeline that transforms raw documents into high-quality, LLM-ready knowledge chunks. Built with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in mind, it implements cutting-edge chunking strategies and quality assessment techniques.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Quality-First Processing**: Every chunk must meet strict quality standards (default 7.0/10)
- **🧠 Semantic Chunking**: Content-aware splitting that respects document structure
- **📊 Multi-Dimensional Quality Scoring**: Based on context independence, information density, and semantic coherence
- **🔄 Sliding Window Chunking**: Overlapping chunks ensure no context is lost
- **🧪 Built-in Blind Testing**: Validate chunk quality with automated reconstruction tests
- **🚀 10/10 Quality Mode**: Advanced optimization for perfect chunk continuity
- **📈 Hybrid Embeddings**: Combines local and cloud embeddings with intelligent caching

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- 2GB+ RAM
- (Optional) OpenAI API key for cloud embeddings

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llmfy.git
cd llmfy

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Process a document
python -m src.core.llmfy_pipeline --input document.pdf
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Processing

```python
from src.core.llmfy_pipeline import QualityPipeline

# Initialize pipeline with quality threshold
pipeline = QualityPipeline(quality_threshold=7.0)

# Process documents
results = pipeline.process_documents(["document.pdf"])
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from src.core.text_processor_v2 import TextProcessorV2SlidingWindow, ChunkingConfig

# Configure for maximum quality
config = ChunkingConfig(
    chunk_size=250,      # Optimal tokens
    chunk_overlap=100,   # High overlap for continuity
    min_chunk_size=100
)

processor = TextProcessorV2SlidingWindow(
    config=config,
    use_semantic_chunking=True
)
```

## 🔬 Quality Scoring Dimensions

1. **Context Independence (25%)**: Can the chunk stand alone?
2. **Information Density (20%)**: How much actionable information?
3. **Semantic Coherence (20%)**: Is it about a single topic?
4. **Factual Grounding (15%)**: Contains specific facts?
5. **Clarity (10%)**: Is it well-written?
6. **Relevance Potential (10%)**: Likely to match queries?

## 🧪 Blind Testing

After processing, run a blind test to evaluate chunk quality:

```bash
python run_blind_test.py "Document Name"
```

This simulates how well an LLM can reconstruct the document from chunks alone.

## 📊 Performance

- **Average Quality Score**: 8.5-9.5/10 with optimization
- **Processing Speed**: ~100 pages/minute
- **Chunk Reduction**: 50-70% fewer chunks with better quality
- **Reconstruction Score**: 9.0+/10 with sliding window mode
