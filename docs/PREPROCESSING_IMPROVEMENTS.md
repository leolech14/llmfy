# Preprocessing Improvements Based on Research

## üéØ What We Implemented

### 1. Optimal Chunk Sizing
- **Changed from**: 1000 characters (old default)
- **Changed to**: 250 tokens (~200-300 optimal per research)
- **Overlap**: 50 tokens (20% for context preservation)

### 2. Contextual Headers (Anthropic's Approach)
Every chunk now includes context headers:
```
[Context: Document: API Guide | Section: Authentication | Category: Technical]

The actual chunk content starts here...
```

**Impact**: Reduces failed retrievals by up to 67%

### 3. Content-Aware Splitting
- **Structure-aware**: Splits at headings, sections, paragraphs
- **Code-aware**: Preserves functions, classes, code blocks
- **Special content**: Tables, lists, and code blocks kept intact

### 4. Smart Preprocessing
```python
# Before chunking:
1. Normalize whitespace (preserve structure)
2. Remove boilerplate (copyright, page numbers)
3. Mark boundaries (code blocks, tables, lists)
4. Clean but preserve semantic meaning
```

### 5. Near-Duplicate Detection
- Uses normalized content hashing
- Removes both exact and near duplicates
- Preserves the first occurrence

## üìä Comparison: Old vs New

| Feature | Old Processor | New Processor |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Chunk Size | 1000 chars | 250 tokens |
| Overlap | 200 chars | 50 tokens (20%) |
| Context Headers | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Structure Aware | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Code Handling | Basic | Smart boundaries |
| Boilerplate Removal | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Duplicate Detection | Exact only | Near-duplicates |

## üöÄ Expected Improvements

Based on research from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Pinecone:

1. **Better Retrieval**: Smaller, focused chunks improve precision
2. **Context Preservation**: Headers make chunks self-contained
3. **Reduced Noise**: Boilerplate removal improves signal-to-noise
4. **Structure Respect**: Natural boundaries improve coherence

## üí° Key Insight

> "Adding context headers alone can reduce retrieval failures by 67%" - Anthropic Research

## üìù Usage Example

```python
from src.core.text_processor_v2 import TextProcessorV2, ChunkingConfig

# Custom configuration
config = ChunkingConfig(
    chunk_size=300,      # Slightly larger chunks
    chunk_overlap=60,    # More overlap
    min_chunk_size=50,   # Skip tiny chunks
    max_chunk_size=600   # Allow larger for special content
)

processor = TextProcessorV2(config)
chunks = processor.process_documents(documents)
```

## üîÑ Migration Path

1. New pipeline automatically uses TextProcessorV2
2. Old TextProcessor still available for compatibility
3. Can switch between them by changing import
